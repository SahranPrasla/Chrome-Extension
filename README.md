# UH Cougar Grades Course Assistant
This repository contains the source code for a Course Information Chrome Extension for students at the University of Houston. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this chrome extension is to provide information for a given course in one area to make course selections easier and more efficient. This utilizes information from the Cougar Grades API as well as hyperlinks to professor reviews.

## How To Use
To use this chrome extension follow the following steps:
  1. Login to your AccessUH account.
  2. Click the MyUH Self Service Icon.
  3. Click the card labeled Manage Classes.
  4. Click Search and Enroll and select the semester for which you're course corresponds with.
  5. Search for the course you are looking to enroll in and select the course from the provided selections.
  6. Once the page loads with professsors and time information, click the chrome extension button to execute the script.

## Future Plans
Currently this extension only provides information on courses but I am looking into providing similar information for professors using the API.
